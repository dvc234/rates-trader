/**
 * SpotBuyOperation executes a spot buy order using 1inch Fusion
 * as part of a funding rate arbitrage strategy.
 * 
 * This operation implements a hook/callback mechanism that waits for the
 * short position to be confirmed on-chain before executing the spot buy.
 * This ensures proper delta-neutral positioning by:
 * 
 * 1. Waiting for short position transaction confirmation
 * 2. Reading the confirmed entry price from the blockchain
 * 3. Creating a 1inch Fusion order that triggers when conditions are met
 * 4. Using the short entry price as reference for balanced entry
 * 
 * Execution Flow:
 * 1. Check if short position exists in context (from OpenPerpetualShortOperation)
 * 2. Wait for short position transaction to be confirmed on-chain
 * 3. Calculate capital amount based on percentage
 * 4. Determine order type (market or limit) based on execution mode
 * 5. For limit orders: Use confirmed short entry price as target
 * 6. Create 1inch Fusion order with hook to execute when price conditions met
 * 7. Store order details in ExecutionContext for tracking
 * 
 * Order Types:
 * - Market Order: Executes immediately at current market price
 *   Used when executionMode is 'instant'
 *   Provides immediate execution but may have higher slippage
 * 
 * - Limit Order: Executes at a specific target price or better via 1inch Fusion
 *   Used when executionMode is 'optimized'
 *   References the confirmed short entry price to ensure balanced entry
 *   Uses 1inch Fusion's resolver network to execute when conditions are met
 *   May take longer to fill but provides better price control
 * 
 * 1inch Fusion Integration:
 * 1inch Fusion uses a resolver network that monitors orders and executes them
 * when conditions are met. This is ideal for our use case because:
 * - The resolver acts as the "hook" that triggers execution
 * - Orders can reference specific price targets (short entry price)
 * - Execution happens automatically when conditions are satisfied
 * - No need for continuous monitoring from the TEE
 * 
 * Price Referencing:
 * When priceReference is set to 'short_entry_price', the operation:
 * 1. Waits for the short position transaction to confirm
 * 2. Reads the actual entry price from the confirmed transaction
 * 3. Uses this price as the target for the 1inch Fusion limit order
 * 4. The Fusion resolver network executes when market price matches
 * 
 * This ensures the spot buy happens at approximately the same price as
 * the short, creating a balanced delta-neutral position.
 * 
 * Holding details stored in context.state:
 * - 'spotHolding': Object containing asset, amount, order details
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Create operation to buy BTC spot with 50% capital at short entry price
 * const spotBuyOp = new SpotBuyOperation(
 *   3,                          // Execute third (after short position)
 *   'BTC',                      // Asset to buy
 *   50,                         // Use 50% of capital
 *   'limit',                    // Use limit order
 *   'short_entry_price'         // Reference short entry price
 * );
 * 
 * const result = await spotBuyOp.execute(context);
 * // Result stored in context.state:
 * // - spotHolding: { asset, amount, fusionOrderId, targetPrice }
 * ```

  /**
   * Executes the spot buy order within the TEE with hook/callback mechanism.
   * 
   * Execution flow:
   * 1. Retrieve short position details from context (set by OpenPerpetualShortOperation)
   * 2. Wait for short position transaction to be confirmed on-chain
   * 3. Read the confirmed entry price from the blockchain
   * 4. Calculate capital amount based on percentage and total allocation
   * 5. Determine target price based on order type and price reference
   * 6. Create 1inch Fusion order that acts as a hook/callback:
   *    - For market orders: Execute immediately
   *    - For limit orders: Fusion resolver network monitors and executes when price matches
   * 7. Store order details in ExecutionContext for tracking
   * 
   * Hook/Callback Mechanism:
   * The operation implements a hook pattern by:
   * 1. Waiting for the short position transaction confirmation (the "trigger")
   * 2. Using 1inch Fusion's resolver network as the "callback" mechanism
   * 3. The Fusion resolver automatically executes the order when conditions are met
   * 
   * This ensures the spot buy only happens after the short is confirmed,
   * creating a proper delta-neutral position.
   * 
   * Capital Allocation:
   * Capital Amount = (capitalPercentage / 100) × Total Capital Allocation
   * 
   * Example:
   * - Total capital: $10,000
   * - Capital percentage: 50%
   * - Capital amount: 0.5 × $10,000 = $5,000
   * 
   * Price Determination with Confirmation:
   * - Market Order: 
   *   1. Wait for short position confirmation
   *   2. Execute immediately at current market price
   * 
   * - Limit Order with 'short_entry_price':
   *   1. Wait for short position transaction to confirm
   *   2. Read the actual confirmed entry price from blockchain
   *   3. Create 1inch Fusion limit order with this price as target
   *   4. Fusion resolver network monitors and executes when market price matches
   *   5. This ensures the spot buy happens at approximately the same
   *      price as the confirmed short, creating a balanced position
   * 
   * 1inch Fusion as Hook Mechanism:
   * 1inch Fusion's resolver network acts as the callback/hook:
   * - Resolvers continuously monitor pending orders
   * - When price conditions are met, they execute the order
   * - This provides automatic execution without TEE monitoring
   * - The order remains active until filled or cancelled
   * 
   * Holding details stored in context.state:
   * - 'spotHolding': {
   *     asset: string (e.g., 'BTC'),
   *     amount: string (amount to receive),
   *     fusionOrderId: string (1inch Fusion order ID),
   *     targetPrice: string (target execution price),
   *     amountSpent: string (capital allocated),
